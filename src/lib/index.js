During the camp there will be opportunities for fun, socializing, education and sports. An eventful camp is waiting for you, so get a good night's sleep!”</p>`,

Before then, I was never really involved in student life, and whilst the camp was an amazing final chapter to my Milestone experience, the social aspect of it all is only dawning on me now. I am now more involved in student life than ever before, and I do not feel as though I have left Milestone behind. </p> <p> If you feel nervous about going to the camp just like I was a year ago when signing up, please consider for a moment this picture of a sparkling clean toilet in the camp which is a great testimonial to how considerate and caring other leavers are and that you should definitely sign up!”</p>`,

The repeated class dance, evening bonfires and team games were definitely a highlight! </p> <p> And of course, the infamous last night...”</p>`,

		question:
			"How does the allocation of indoor places work exactly?",
		html: `<p>There is a limited number of indoor sleeping places available. Therefore, we cannot guarantee indoor accommodation for non-leavers. In such cases, we kindly ask you to bring a tent. As a leaver participant, you have the option to deliberately choose to sleep in your own tent. Otherwise, the allocation of indoor places functions on a first-come-first-served basis, with team leaders having priority. You will be notified in due time about whether you need to bring a tent or not.</p>`,

		question:
			"I am scared everyone attending the camp will already be friends and I will feel left out - should I still attend the camp if I am not involved in the community?",

Please rest assured that the group activities will help you meet new people and form new friendships, so you will not feel left out! A Welfare Officer will also be present at the camp to ensure everyone has a comfortable experience.</p>`,

Additionally, Milestone staff members provide assistance and support to ensure the smooth running of the camp. Together, this collaborative effort ensures a fulfilling and memorable experience for all participants. You can find the list of this years organizers <a href="#">here</a>.</p>`,
